# Panda Exchange

Panda Exchange is the interface for the Viper implementation of a market maker smart contract on the Ethereum network. It's deployed to the Rinkeby test network. Check out the contract code [here](https://github.com/ethanbennett/vyper/blob/master/examples/market_maker/on_chain_market_maker.v.py).

The background was adapted from a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/jhnsnc/pen/Mprdaa) by Chris Johnson.
